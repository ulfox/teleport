## Manual Testing Plan

Below are the items that should be manually tested with each release of Teleport.
These tests should be run on both a fresh install of the version to be released
as well as an upgrade of the previous version of Teleport.

- [ ] Adding nodes to a cluster
  - [ ] Adding Nodes via Valid Static Token
  - [ ] Adding Nodes via Valid Short-lived Tokens
  - [ ] Adding Nodes via Invalid Token Fails
  - [ ] Revoking Node Invitation

- [ ] Labels
  - [ ] Static Labels
  - [ ] Dynamic Labels

- [ ] Trusted Clusters
  - [ ] Adding Trusted Cluster Valid Static Token
  - [ ] Adding Trusted Cluster Valid Short-lived Token
  - [ ] Adding Trusted Cluster Invalid Token
  - [ ] Removing Trusted Cluster

- [ ] RBAC

  Make sure that invalid and valid attempts are reflected in audit log.

  - [ ] Successfully connect to node with correct role
  - [ ] Unsuccessfully connect to a node in a role restricting access by label
  - [ ] Unsuccessfully connect to a node in a role restricting access by invalid SSH login
  - [ ] Allow/deny role option: SSH agent forwarding
  - [ ] Allow/deny role option: Port forwarding

- [ ] Verify that custom PAM environment variables are available as expected.

- [ ] Users

    With every user combination, try to login and signup with invalid second
    factor, invalid password to see how the system reacts.

    WebAuthn in the release `tsh` binary is implemented using libfido2. Ask for
    a statically built pre-release binary for realistic tests. (`tsh fido2 diag`
    should work in our binary.)

    Touch ID requires a signed `tsh`, ask for a signed pre-release binary so you
    may run the tests.

  - [ ] Adding Users Password Only
  - [ ] Adding Users OTP
  - [ ] Adding Users WebAuthn
  - [ ] Adding Users Touch ID
  - [ ] Managing MFA devices
    - [ ] Add an OTP device with `tsh mfa add`
    - [ ] Add a WebAuthn device with `tsh mfa add`
    - [ ] Add a Touch ID device with `tsh mfa add`
    - [ ] List MFA devices with `tsh mfa ls`
    - [ ] Remove an OTP device with `tsh mfa rm`
    - [ ] Remove a WebAuthn device with `tsh mfa rm`
    - [ ] Attempt removing the last MFA device on the user
      - [ ] with `second_factor: on` in `auth_service`, should fail
      - [ ] with `second_factor: optional` in `auth_service`, should succeed
  - [ ] Login Password Only
  - [ ] Login with MFA
    - [ ] Add an OTP, a WebAuthn and a Touch ID device with `tsh mfa add`
    - [ ] Login via OTP
    - [ ] Login via WebAuthn
    - [ ] Login via Touch ID
    - [ ] Login via WebAuthn using an U2F device

    U2F devices must be registered in a previous version of Teleport.

    Using Teleport v9, set `auth_service.authentication.second_factor = u2f`,
    restart the server and then register an U2F device (`tsh mfa add`). Upgrade
    the install to the current Teleport version (one major at a time) and try to
    login using the U2F device as your second factor - it should work.

  - [ ] Login OIDC
  - [ ] Login SAML
  - [ ] Login GitHub
  - [ ] Deleting Users

- [ ] Backends
  - [ ] Teleport runs with etcd
  - [ ] Teleport runs with dynamodb
  - [ ] Teleport runs with SQLite
  - [ ] Teleport runs with Firestore

- [ ] Session Recording
  - [ ] Session recording can be disabled
  - [ ] Sessions can be recorded at the node
    - [ ] Sessions in remote clusters are recorded in remote clusters
  - [ ] Sessions can be recorded at the proxy
    - [ ] Sessions on remote clusters are recorded in the local cluster
    - [ ] Enable/disable host key checking.

- [ ] Audit Log
  - [ ] Failed login attempts are recorded
  - [ ] Interactive sessions have the correct Server ID
    - [ ] Server ID is the ID of the node in "session_recording: node" mode
    - [ ] Server ID is the ID of the proxy in "session_recording: proxy" mode

    Node/Proxy ID may be found at `/var/lib/teleport/host_uuid` in the
    corresponding machine.

    Node IDs may also be queried via `tctl nodes ls`.

  - [ ] Exec commands are recorded
  - [ ] `scp` commands are recorded
  - [ ] Subsystem results are recorded

    Subsystem testing may be achieved using both
    [Recording Proxy mode](
    https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/architecture/proxy/#recording-proxy-mode)
    and
    [OpenSSH integration](
    https://goteleport.com/docs/server-access/guides/openssh/).

    Assuming the proxy is `proxy.example.com:3023` and `node1` is a node running
    OpenSSH/sshd, you may use the following command to trigger a subsystem audit
    log:

    ```shell
    sftp -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p" root@node1
    ```

- [ ] Interact with a cluster using `tsh`

   These commands should ideally be tested for recording and non-recording modes as they are implemented in a different ways.

  - [ ] tsh ssh \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] tsh ssh \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] tsh ssh -A \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] tsh ssh -A \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] tsh ssh \<regular-node\> ls
  - [ ] tsh ssh \<node-remote-cluster\> ls
  - [ ] tsh join \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] tsh join \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] tsh play \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] tsh play \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] tsh scp \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] tsh scp \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] tsh ssh -L \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] tsh ssh -L \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] tsh ls
  - [ ] tsh clusters

- [ ] Interact with a cluster using `ssh`
   Make sure to test both recording and regular proxy modes.
  - [ ] ssh \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] ssh \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] ssh -A \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] ssh -A \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] ssh \<regular-node\> ls
  - [ ] ssh \<node-remote-cluster\> ls
  - [ ] scp \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] scp \<node-remote-cluster\>
  - [ ] ssh -L \<regular-node\>
  - [ ] ssh -L \<node-remote-cluster\>

- [ ] Verify proxy jump functionality
  Log into leaf cluster via root, shut down the root proxy and verify proxy jump works.
  - [ ] tsh ssh -J \<leaf-proxy\>
  - [ ] ssh -J \<leaf-proxy\>

- [ ] Interact with a cluster using the Web UI
  - [ ] Connect to a Teleport node
  - [ ] Connect to a OpenSSH node
  - [ ] Check agent forwarding is correct based on role and proxy mode.

- [ ] Verify that active interactive sessions are tracked in `/var/run/utmp` on Linux.
- [ ] Verify that interactive sessions are logged in `/var/log/wtmp` on Linux.

### Combinations

For some manual testing, many combinations need to be tested. For example, for
interactive sessions the 12 combinations are below.

- [ ] Connect to a OpenSSH node in a local cluster using OpenSSH.
- [ ] Connect to a OpenSSH node in a local cluster using Teleport.
- [ ] Connect to a OpenSSH node in a local cluster using the Web UI.

### Teleport with EKS/GKE

* [ ] Deploy Teleport on a single EKS cluster
* [ ] Deploy Teleport on two EKS clusters and connect them via trusted cluster feature
* [ ] Deploy Teleport Proxy outside of GKE cluster fronting connections to it (use [this script](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/examples/k8s-auth/get-kubeconfig.sh) to generate a kubeconfig)
* [ ] Deploy Teleport Proxy outside of EKS cluster fronting connections to it (use [this script](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/examples/k8s-auth/get-kubeconfig.sh) to generate a kubeconfig)

### Teleport with multiple Kubernetes clusters

Note: you can use GKE or EKS or minikube to run Kubernetes clusters.
Minikube is the only caveat - it's not reachable publicly so don't run a proxy there.

* [ ] Deploy combo auth/proxy/kubernetes_service outside of a Kubernetes cluster, using a kubeconfig
  * [ ] Login with `tsh login`, check that `tsh kube ls` has your cluster
  * [ ] Run `kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl exec -it $SOME_POD -- sh`

  * [ ] Login with `tsh login`, check that `tsh kube ls` has your cluster
  * [ ] Run `kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl exec -it $SOME_POD -- sh`
  * [ ] Verify that the audit log recorded the above request and session
* [ ] Deploy a second kubernetes_service inside of another Kubernetes cluster, connected over a reverse tunnel
  * [ ] Login with `tsh login`, check that `tsh kube ls` has both clusters

  * [ ] Login with `tsh login`, check that `tsh kube ls` has all clusters
* [ ] Test Kubernetes screen in the web UI (tab is located on left side nav on dashboard):
  * [ ] Verify that all kubes registered are shown with correct `name` and `labels`
  * [ ] Verify that clicking on a rows connect button renders a dialogue on manual instructions with `Step 2` login value matching the rows `name` column
  * [ ] Verify searching for `name` or `labels` in the search bar works
  * [ ] Verify you can sort by `name` colum

### Teleport with FIPS mode

* [ ] Perform trusted clusters, Web and SSH sanity check with all teleport components deployed in FIPS mode.

### ACME

- [ ] Teleport can fetch TLS certificate automatically using ACME protocol.

### Migrations

* [ ] Migrate trusted clusters from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0
  * [ ] Migrate auth server on main cluster, then rest of the servers on main cluster
        SSH should work for both main and old clusters
  * [ ] Migrate auth server on remote cluster, then rest of the remote cluster
       SSH should work

### Command Templates

When interacting with a cluster, the following command templates are useful:

#### OpenSSH

```
# when connecting to the recording proxy, `-o 'ForwardAgent yes'` is required.
ssh -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p" \
  node.example.com

# the above command only forwards the agent to the proxy, to forward the agent
# to the target node, `-o 'ForwardAgent yes'` needs to be passed twice.
ssh -o "ForwardAgent yes" \
  -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p" \
  node.example.com

# when connecting to a remote cluster using OpenSSH, the subsystem request is
# updated with the name of the remote cluster.
ssh -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p@foo.com" \
  node.foo.com
```

#### Teleport

```
# when connecting to a OpenSSH node, remember `-p 22` needs to be passed.
tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=<username> --insecure ssh -p 22 node.example.com

# an agent can be forwarded to the target node with `-A`
tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=<username> --insecure ssh -A -p 22 node.example.com

# the --cluster flag is used to connect to a node in a remote cluster.
tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=<username> --insecure ssh --cluster=foo.com -p 22 node.foo.com
```

### `tctl sso` family of commands

`tctl sso configure` helps to construct a valid connector definition:

- [ ] `tctl sso configure github ...` creates valid connector definitions
- [ ] `tctl sso configure oidc ...` creates valid connector definitions
- [ ] `tctl sso configure saml ...` creates valid connector definitions

`tctl sso test` test a provided connector definition, which can be loaded from
file or piped in with `tctl sso configure` or `tctl get --with-secrets`. Valid
connectors are accepted, invalid are rejected with sensible error messages.

- [ ] Connectors can be tested with `tctl sso test`.
    - [ ] GitHub

### AWS Node Joining
[Docs](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/guides/joining-nodes-aws/)
- [ ] On EC2 instance with `ec2:DescribeInstances` permissions for local account:
  `TELEPORT_TEST_EC2=1 go test ./integration -run TestEC2NodeJoin`
- [ ] On EC2 instance with any attached role:
  `TELEPORT_TEST_EC2=1 go test ./integration -run TestIAMNodeJoin`
- [ ] EC2 Join method in IoT mode with node and auth in different AWS accounts
- [ ] IAM Join method in IoT mode with node and auth in different AWS accounts

### Passwordless

Passwordless requires `tsh` compiled with libfido2 for most operations (apart
from Touch ID). Ask for a statically-built `tsh` binary for realistic tests.

Touch ID requires a properly built and signed `tsh` binary. Ask for a
pre-release binary so you may run the tests.

This sections complements "Users -> Managing MFA devices". Ideally both macOS
and Linux `tsh` binaries are tested for FIDO2 items.

- [ ] Diagnostics

    Both commands should pass all tests.

  - [ ] `tsh fido2 diag`
  - [ ] `tsh touchid diag`

- [ ] Registration
  - [ ] Register a passworldess FIDO2 key (`tsh mfa add`, choose WEBAUTHN and
        passwordless)
  - [ ] Register a Touch ID credential (`tsh mfa add`, choose TOUCHID)

- [ ] Login
  - [ ] Passwordless login using FIDO2 (`tsh login --auth=passwordless`)
  - [ ] Passwordless login using Touch ID (`tsh login --auth=passwordless`)
  - [ ] `tsh login --auth=passwordless --mfa-mode=cross-platform` uses FIDO2
  - [ ] `tsh login --auth=passwordless --mfa-mode=platform` uses Touch ID
  - [ ] `tsh login --auth=passwordless --mfa-mode=auto` prefers Touch ID
  - [ ] Passwordless disable switch works
        (`auth_service.authentication.passwordless = false`)
  - [ ] Cluster in passwordless mode defaults to passwordless
        (`auth_service.authentication.connector_name = passwordless`)
  - [ ] Cluster in passwordless mode allows MFA login
        (`tsh login --auth=local`)

- [ ] Touch ID support commands
  - [ ] `tsh touchid ls` works
  - [ ] `tsh touchid rm` works (careful, may lock you out!)

## Access Requests

### Creating Access Requests
1. Create a role with limited permissions (defined below as `allow-roles`). This role allows you to see the Role screen and ssh into all nodes.
1. Create another role with limited permissions (defined below as `allow-users`). This role session expires in 4 minutes, allows you to see Users screen, and denies access to all nodes.
1. Create another role with no permissions other than being able to create requests (defined below as `default`)
1. Create a user with role `default` assigned
1. Create a few requests under this user to test pending/approved/denied state.
```

        a relevant error message.
  - [ ] RBAC for sessions: ensure users can only see their own recordings when
    using the RBAC rule from our
    [docs](../../docs/pages/access-controls/reference.mdx#rbac-for-sessions)
