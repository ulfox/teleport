Troubleshooting SSO configuration can be challenging. Usually a Teleport administrator
must be able to:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>
- Ensure that HTTP/TLS certificates are configured properly for both Teleport
  proxy and the SSO provider.
</ScopedBlock>
- Be able to see what SAML/OIDC claims and values are getting exported and passed
  by the SSO provider to Teleport.
- Be able to see how Teleport maps the received claims to role mappings as defined
  in the connector.

If something is not working, we recommend to:

- Double-check the host names, tokens and TCP ports in a connector definition.

### Using the Web UI

If you get "access denied" or other login errors, the number one place to check is the Audit
Log. You can access it in the **Activity** tab of the Teleport Web UI.

Example of a user being denied because the role `clusteradmin` wasn't set up:

```json
{
  "code": "T1001W",
  "error": "role clusteradmin is not found",
  "event": "user.login",
  "method": "oidc",
  "success": false,
  "time": "2019-06-15T19:38:07Z",
  "uid": "cd9e45d0-b68c-43c3-87cf-73c4e0ec37e9"
}
```

### Teleport does not show the expected Nodes

(!docs/pages/includes/node-logins.mdx!)

When configuring SSO, ensure that the identity provider is populating each user's 
traits correctly. For a user to see a Node in Teleport, the result of populating a
 template variable in a role's `allow.logins` must match at least one of a user's
 `traits.logins`.


In this example a user will have usernames `ubuntu`, `debian` and usernames from the SSO trait `logins` for Nodes that have a `env: dev` label.  If the SSO trait username is `bob` then the usernames would include `ubuntu`, `debian`, and `bob`.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: example-role
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ['{{external.logins}}', ubuntu, debian]
    node_labels:
      'env': 'dev'
version: v5
```
