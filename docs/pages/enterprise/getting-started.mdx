There are three types of services Teleport can run:

- **Auth Service** stores user accounts and provides authentication and
  authorization for every agent and every user in a cluster.
- **Proxy Service** routes client connection requests to the appropriate agent
  and serves a Web UI that can also be used to access resources.
- **Agents** provide access to resources including SSH servers, Kubernetes
  clusters, web applications and databases. 
  
In this guide, we will highlight the Teleport SSH Service. The SSH Service is
similar to the `sshd` daemon you may be familiar with. SSH Service instances are
called **Teleport Nodes**. When a Teleport Node receives a connection request,
the request is authenticated through the cluster's Auth Service.

The `teleport` daemon runs all three of these services by default.

This guide will run a Teleport cluster consisting of the Auth Service, Proxy
Service, and SSH Service, and interact with the cluster using Teleport's
client-side tools:

| Tool | Description |
| - | - |
| tctl | Cluster administration tool used to invite Nodes to a cluster and manage user accounts. |
| tsh | Allows users to authenticate and access resources via their local machine. `tsh`'s SSH functionality is similar in principle to OpenSSH's `ssh`. Users can log in to remote Nodes, list and search for Nodes in a cluster, securely upload/download files, etc. |
| browser | You can use your web browser to log in to any Teleport Node by opening `https://<proxy-host>:3080`. |


## Prerequisites

You will need to have access to the [customer portal](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login)
to download the software. You will also need three computers: two servers and
one client (probably a laptop) to complete this tutorial. Let's assume the servers have
the following DNS names and IPs:

| Server Name | IP Address | Purpose |
| - | - | - |
| *"auth.example.com"* | 10.1.1.10 | This server will be used to run all three Teleport services: auth, proxy and ssh. |
| *"node.example.com"* | 10.1.1.11 | This server will only run the SSH service. |

This Quick Start Guide assumes that both servers are running a [systemd-based](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/)
Linux distribution such as Debian, Ubuntu or a RHEL derivative.  The *node.example.com* must be able to connect to the *auth.example.com* `3025` port and the *auth.example.com* must be able to connect to the 3022 port on *node.example.com*.

## Optional: Quickstart using Docker

The instructions below describe how to install Teleport Enterprise directly onto your test system. You can also [run Teleport Enterprise using Docker](#run-teleport-enterprise-using-docker)
if you don't want to install Teleport Enterprise binaries straight away.

## Installing

To start using Teleport Enterprise, you will need to Download the binaries and the license file from the [customer portal](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login).
After downloading the binary tarball, run:

```bsh
$ tar -xzf teleport-ent-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
$ cd teleport-ent
```

- Copy `teleport` and `tctl` binaries to a bin directory (we suggest `/usr/local/bin`) on the auth server.
- Copy `teleport` binary to a bin directory on the node server.
- Copy `tsh` binary to a bin directory on the client computer.

### License File

The Teleport license file contains a X.509 certificate and the corresponding
private key in [PEM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail).

Download the license file from the [customer portal](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login)
and save it as `/var/lib/teleport/license.pem` on the auth server.

### Systemd Unit File

Next, download the systemd service unit file from [examples directory](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/systemd)
on Github and save it as `/etc/systemd/system/teleport.service` on both servers.

```bsh
# run this on both servers:
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable teleport
```

### Configuration File

Save the following configuration file as `/etc/teleport.yaml` on the *auth.example.com*:

```yaml
teleport:
  nodename: auth.example.com
  auth_token: dogs-are-much-nicer-than-cats
  auth_servers: [ "localhost:3025" ]

proxy_service:
  # enable the proxy service
  enabled: true

auth_service:
  # enable the auth service:
  enabled: true

  tokens:
  # this static token is used for other nodes to join this Teleport cluster
  - proxy,node:dogs-are-much-nicer-than-cats
  # this token is used to establish trust with other Teleport clusters
  - trusted_cluster:trains-are-superior-to-cars

  # by default, local authentication will be used with 2FA
  authentication:
      second_factor: otp

  # SSH is also enabled on this node:
ssh_service:
  enabled: "yes"
```

## Start Teleport on *auth.example.com*

Start the Teleport service and confirm the service has started. After it has started you can get the Certificate Authority (CA) pin that has been generated.

```bsh
$ sudo systemctl start teleport
# confirm Teleport started
$ sudo systemctl status teleport
# after successful start retrieve the CA pin for using in the node
$ sudo tctl status
Cluster  teleport
Version  (=version=)
Host CA  never updated
User CA  never updated
Jwt CA   never updated
CA pin   sha256:58b1c5cb8885d84ce08f3e3a47acb33d49841f12dd7648c0c1dd31bd501628
```

Copy the CA pin from the output of `tctl status`. On `node.example.com` save the following configuration file as `/etc/teleport.yaml`
and use the CA pin you copied as the value of `ca_pin`.

```yaml
teleport:
  nodename: node.example.com
  auth_token: dogs-are-much-nicer-than-cats
  # you can also use auth server's IP, i.e. "10.1.1.10:3025"
  auth_servers: [ "auth.example.com:3025" ]
  # Set the ca_pin value so it can verify the Teleport server
  ca_pin: sha256:58b1c5cb8885d84ce08f3e...

  # enable ssh service and disable auth and proxy:
ssh_service:
  enabled: true
auth_service:
  enabled: false
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
```

## Start Node service

```bsh
# run this on node server:
$ sudo systemctl start teleport
# Confirm node has started successfully and connected
$ sudo systemctl status teleport
```

## Teleport Status and Networking

You can review the logs of the Teleport service with `journalctl -fu teleport` and see its current status
with `sudo systemctl status teleport`.

You can use `netstat -lptne` to review the port that Teleport is
listening on  on [TCP/IP ports](../setup/reference/networking.mdx#ports). On *auth.example.com*, it should
look something like this:

```bsh
$ auth.example.com ~: sudo netstat -lptne
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address   State       User       PID/Program name
tcp6       0      0 :::3024         LISTEN      0          337/teleport
tcp6       0      0 :::3025         LISTEN      0          337/teleport
tcp6       0      0 :::3080         LISTEN      0          337/teleport
tcp6       0      0 :::3022         LISTEN      0          337/teleport
tcp6       0      0 :::3023         LISTEN      0          337/teleport
```

and *node.example.com* should look something like this:

```bsh
$ node.example.com ~: sudo netstat -lptne
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address   State       User       PID/Program name
tcp6       0      0 :::3022         LISTEN      0          337/teleport
```

See [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section at the bottom if something is not working.

## Adding Users

This portion of the Quick Start Guide should be performed on the auth server, i.e.
on *auth.example.com*

Every user in a Teleport cluster must be assigned at least one role. By default,
Teleport comes with several pre-configured roles known as
["presets"](../access-controls/reference.mdx#preset-roles). You can see
these roles by executing `sudo tctl get roles`.

Pay attention to the *allow/logins* field in the role definition: by default, this
role only allows SSH logins as `root@host`.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: access
spec:
  allow:
    logins:
    - '{{internal.logins}}'
    - root
```

You probably want to replace "root" with something else. Let's assume there will
be a local UNIX account called "admin" on all hosts. In this case you can
dump the role definition YAML into a file and update "allow/logins"
to look like this:

```yaml
allow:
   logins: [admin]
```

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="Note"
>
  See the [Kubernetes Guide](../kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx) and [Application Guide](../application-access/introduction.mdx) for enabling access to additional resources.
</Admonition>

Then send it back into Teleport:

```bsh
$ sudo tctl create -f role.yaml
```

Now, lets create a new Teleport user "joe" with "access" role:

```bsh
$ sudo tctl users add --roles=access --logins=joe,ubuntu,ec2-user joe

Signup token has been created and is valid for 1 hours. Share this URL with the user:
https://auth.example.com:3080/web/newuser/22e3acb6a0c2cde22f13bdc879ff9d2a
```

Share the generated sign-up URL with Joe and let him pick a password and configure
the second factor authentication. We recommend [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator)
which is available for both Android and iPhone.

## Assigning Roles

To update user's roles, dump the user resource into a file:

```bsh
$ sudo tctl get users/joe > joe.yaml
```

Edit the YAML file and update the "roles" array.
Then, re-insert it back:

```bsh
$ sudo tctl create -f joe.yaml
```

## Logging In

Joe now has a local account on a Teleport cluster. The local account is good for
administrative purposes but regular users of Teleport Enterprise should be using
a Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism.

But first, lets see how Joe can log into the Teleport cluster. He can do this
on his client laptop:

```bsh
$ tsh --proxy=auth.example.com --insecure login --user=joe
```

Note that "--user=joe" part can be omitted if `$USER` environment variable is "joe".

Notice that `tsh` client always needs `--proxy` flag because all client connections
in Teleport always must to go through an SSH proxy, sometimes called an "SSH bastion".

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Warning"
>
  For the purposes of this quickstart we are using the `--insecure` flag which allows
  us to skip configuring the HTTPS/TLS certificate for Teleport proxy. Your browser will
  throw a warning **Your connection is not private**. Click Advanced, and **Proceed to 0.0.0.0 (unsafe)**
  to preview the Teleport UI.

  Never use `--insecure` in production unless you terminate SSL at a load balancer. This will
  apply to most cloud providers (AWS, GCP and Azure). You must configure a HTTP/TLS certificate for the Proxy.
  This process has been made easier with Let's Encrypt. [We've instructions here](https://goteleport.com/blog/letsencrypt-teleport-ssh/).
</Admonition>

If successful, `tsh login` command will receive Joe's user certificate and will
store it in `~/.tsh/keys/<proxy>` directory.

With a certificate in place, Joe can now interact with the Teleport cluster:

```code
# See what hosts are available behind the proxy:
$ tsh ls

# SSH into any host behind the proxy (Unix user 'joe' should already exist on the node):
$ tsh ssh joe@node.example.com

# Log out (this will remove the user certificate from ~/.tsh)
$ tsh logout
```

## Configuring SSO

The local account is good for administrative purposes but regular users of
Teleport Enterprise should be using a Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism that use SAML or OIDC protocols.

Take a look at the [Single Sign-on](sso.mdx) chapter to learn the basics of
integrating Teleport with SSO providers. We have the following detailed guides for
configuring SSO providers:

- [Okta](sso/okta.mdx)
- [Active Directory](sso/adfs.mdx)
- [One Login](sso/one-login.mdx)
- [Github](../setup/admin/github-sso.mdx)

Any SAML-compliant provider can be configured with Teleport by following the
same steps.  There are Teleport Enterprise customers who are using Oracle IDM,
SailPoint and others.

## Run Teleport Enterprise using Docker

We provide pre-built Docker images for every version of Teleport Enterprise. These images are hosted on quay.io.

- [All tags under `quay.io/gravitational/teleport-ent` are Teleport Enterprise images](https://quay.io/repository/gravitational/teleport-ent?tag=latest\&tab=tags)

We currently only offer Docker images for `x86_64` architectures.

<Admonition type="note">
  You will need a recent version of [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=\&type=edition\&offering=community) installed to follow this section of the quick start guide.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning">
  This setup will not let you 'SSH into' the node that is running Teleport without additional configuration.
</Admonition>

### Pick your image

(!docs/pages/includes/enterprise/docker-images.mdx!)

### Quickstart using docker-compose

<Admonition type="note">
  You will need a recent version of [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed to follow this section of the quick start guide.
</Admonition>

The easiest way to start Teleport Enterprise quickly is to use `docker-compose` with our [`teleport-ent-quickstart.yml`](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/docker/teleport-ent-quickstart.yml) file:

```code
# download the quickstart file from our Github repo
$ curl -Lso teleport-ent-quickstart.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitational/teleport/master/docker/teleport-ent-quickstart.yml

# start teleport quickstart using docker-compose
$ docker-compose -f teleport-ent-quickstart.yml up
```

- The `docker-compose` quickstart will automatically create a config file for you at `./docker/teleport/config/teleport.yaml`
- This config is mounted into the container under `/etc/teleport/teleport.yaml`
- It will also start `teleport` using this config file, with Teleport's data directory set to `./docker/teleport/data` and mounted under `/var/lib/teleport`
- It will mount your license file (named `license.pem`) from the current directory into the Docker container
- By default, `docker-compose` will output Teleport's logs to the console for you to observe.
  - If you would rather run the Teleport container in the background, use `docker-compose -f teleport-ent-quickstart.yml up -d`
  - You can stop the Teleport container using `docker-compose -f teleport-ent-quickstart.yml down`

### Quickstart using docker run

If you'd prefer to complete these steps manually, here's some sample `docker run` commands:

```code
# create local config and data directories for teleport, which will be mounted into the container
$ mkdir -p ~/teleport/config ~/teleport/data

# download your license file from the Gravitational dashboard and put it in the correct directory
# the file needs to be named license.pem
$ cp ~/downloads/downloaded-license.pem ~/teleport/data/license.pem

# generate a sample teleport config and write it to the local config directory
# this container will write the config and immediately exit - this is expected
$ docker run --hostname localhost --rm \
  --entrypoint=/bin/sh \
  -v ~/teleport/config:/etc/teleport \
  (=teleport.latest_ent_docker_image=) -c "teleport configure > /etc/teleport/teleport.yaml"

# change the path to the license file in the sample config
$ sed -i 's_/path/to/license-if-using-teleport-enterprise.pem_/var/lib/teleport/license.pem_g' ~/teleport/config/teleport.yaml

# start teleport with mounted license, config and data directories, plus all ports
$ docker run --hostname localhost --name teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/config:/etc/teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/data:/var/lib/teleport \
  -p 3023:3023 -p 3025:3025 -p 3080:3080 \
  (=teleport.latest_ent_docker_image=)
```

### Creating a Teleport user when using Docker quickstart

To create a user inside your Teleport Enterprise container, use `docker exec`.

This example command will create a Teleport user called `testuser` which has the
`access` role. Feel free to change these to suit your needs.

```code
$ docker exec teleport tctl users add --roles=access --logins=root,ec2-user,ubuntu testuser
```

When you run this command, Teleport will output a URL which you must open to complete the user signup process:

```txt
User testuser has been created but requires a password. Share this URL with the user to complete user setup, link is valid for 1h0m0s:
https://localhost:3080/web/invite/4f2718a52ce107568b191f222ba069f7

NOTE: Make sure localhost:3080 points at a Teleport proxy which users can access.
```

You can now [follow this guide from "Adding Users"](#adding-users) onwards to create your user and log into Teleport Enterprise.

## Troubleshooting

If Teleport services do not start, take a look at the syslog:

```code
$ sudo journalctl -fu teleport
```

Usually the error will be reported there. Common reasons for failure are:

- Mismatched tokens, i.e. "auth_token" on the node does not match "tokens/node" value on the auth server.
- Network issues: port `3025` is closed via iptables.
- Network issues: ports `3025` or `3022` are occupied by another process.
- Disk issues: Teleport fails to create `/var/lib/teleport` because the volume is read-only or not accessible.
